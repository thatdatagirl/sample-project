### Overall Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

This project took around 30 - 45 minutes to complete. The instructions are easy to follow and a good introduction to using GitHub to create repositories and scripting. For those with little to no experience with GitHub, navigating the platform can be challenging at first but the instructions lead you step by step and include examples if needed. After completing Part A of the project I am able to put into practice some of what we have learned in the Cloud Data Engineering Tech Track. I also enjoy working with automation to help improve efficiency and reduce  manual workload. I look forward to automating more processes in the future.
